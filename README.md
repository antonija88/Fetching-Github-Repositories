# ingemark_app

Ingemark Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Application fetches list of repositories from API (https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=zagor)
and results are displayed in list.

For development I used:
Riverpod, Riverpod Hooks - State Management System
Freezed - package for generating data class
Dio - package for HTTP requests
